#### Rationale

Rather than just share your latest gripes on social media, use a centralized hub to store and share information about unethical corporate and political behaviour. 

> I almost gave up on my social media accounts because there was so much negativity. Now I just look at pictures of cats, and leave my corporate complaints to Boycott Inc. I've learned so much from like minded boycotters. 

-Steve from Accounts

#### Description

Upload and edit information about your chosen boycotts. Leave comments and related links.

#### Benefits

* **Teach:** Share information about chosen boycotts with other people around the world.

* **Learn:** Learn from others as they add informative links and share their stories and experiences.

* **Campaign:** Sometimes a few voices can be drowned out, but together we are strong enough to make our targets notice our discontent.
